//! TDISP is a standardized interface for end-to-end encryption and attestation
//! of trusted assigned devices to confidential/isolated partitions. This crate
//! implements structures and interfaces for the host and guest to prepare and
//! assign trusted devices. Examples of technologies that implement TDISP
//! include:
//! - IntelÂ® "TDX Connect"
//! - AMD SEV-TIO
